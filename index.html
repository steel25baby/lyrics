<h1>LYRICS</h1>
<pre> 
    It ain't me
    It ain't me
    It ain't me <br>
    I had a dream
    We were sipping whiskey neat
    Highest floor of The Bowery
    Nowhere's high enough
    Somewhere along the lines
    We stopped seeing eye to eye
    You were staying out all night
    And I had enough <br>
    No, I don't wanna know
    Where you've been or where you're going
    But I know I won't be home
    And you'll be on your own <br>
    Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
    Who's gonna rock you when the Sun won't let you sleep?
    It ain't me <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    I had a dream
    We were back to seventeen
    Summer nights and the liberties
    Never growing up
    I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories
    But you know I'm gonna leave
    Behind the worst of us <br>
    Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
    Who's gonna rock you when the Sun won't let you sleep?
    Who's waking up to drive you home?
    When you're drunk and all alone
    Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
    It ain't me <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go
    It ain't me! <br>
    Na, na, in The Bowery
    Na, na, and the whiskey neat
    Where go, are you going?
    Where go?
    It ain't me!
    It ain't me!</pre>
